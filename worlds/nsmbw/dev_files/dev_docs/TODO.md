- Just look in memory where store player data, follow intruc, find size -> multiplayer
  - dAcPy_c__data : length 0x2d08
  - daPlBase_c::GravityData
  - daPlBase_c__data
  - daPlBase_c__vt : hold func pointers
- multiplayer
  - Separate powerup unlocks?
- handle deathlink better
- Remove cost from hint movies???
  - PRO: no logic trouble, no imposilbe seeds
  - CON: star coins does less
- lower req for grinding poweruops


## Playtest

- deathlink amnisty
- death-trap no deathlink


## Bugs to fix
- still sends false deathlinks
- overwrite level comp ?
  - Heya! So I had an issue with save states. Everything worked fine during the first bit of an AP I did, Everything continued to work fine till this morning after about an hour of game time. For some reason my save states were automatically being loaded instead of saved, and while I did have back-up save states, I did have an issue of that messing with future aspects as all my levels I completed with star coins suddenly went uncleared. The only thing that was unlocked was secret exit paths in levels I cleared with a secret exit but couldn't get that fixed afterwards. I did use the recent version posted not long ago so i'm unsure if this was an issue on my end I could have fixed or not.
  - I had a back-up save state in Worlds 3 & 9, which were the two worlds I was focusing on and I believe the issues started after beating 9-8 or 9-3? The world 3 back-up state was only a few levels behind (like 2 or 3). However after beating like one or two levels, the game started loading a state it made itself in World 4. So whenever I tried loading the World 9 or World 3 state, things ended up breaking and even one of my back-up states got messed up as the game auto-stated the same moment I save stated. Luckily it was only one of them (I usually make two states just in case) but, yeah the issues started in world 9 but carried over even into world 3 where world 9 was never even touched on that particular state.
- Deathlink are not receiving (for 1 player)
- Climb is locked even though it is excluded : 5 vines etc
- 1-castle comp message send when it shouldn't


## Short term
- Multiplayer support
  - find other player pointers : for lives and powerups
  - Kill when in water
- Us pipe rando patches : always move next world → never
  - Look at pipe rando code for different patches : always move to next world seems useful
- fix UT-autotab : actually works? : needs to just update on switch and not death
- Hint movies does not work on other save files?
- Dereference player  pointer
- Add support for multiplayer and other savefile support
- Add enemy ambush and toad rescue
- PERSISTANTSTORAGE instead of local save file
- I have issue with fuzzing with hooks: UT 
- Do playthrough, document completion times for time logic
- Fix so work with multiple dolphin instances (so players can have all games open at same time)
- Inventory pow doesn't work on other save files
- toad resqu location
- toad house doesn't work to set, probably needs to update other location too
  - toad add1  80c807f0
  - toad add2  80c80f22


## Broken versions
# EU 1
- Movement

# EU 2
- Skipp intro
- Filler on other save files, in level check failing?

# US 1
- Star and swim


## Mid term
- Implement graphics for Hint movie shop
  - Try to change hm menu to show which movies unlocks which items 
  - Need to include new messages.arc and some patch code
- Create functions that are called at start/end of level instead of continuously? (to optimize code)
  - Remove having to loop though all checks each frame?
- Bases on death messages create an ingame text message
- Change how world9 and peach function for better savestates : edit how worlds unlock, could try follow save address in dolphin
- make all levels unlock from start of world
- Riivolution patch that changes world map unlock order and which level required to leave
- Use persistent storage? for save file data instead of creating files?
- Implement light geck-code parsing?
- World enemies
  - exists specific memory location
- Rescue toad on world map
  - exists specific memory location
- Protocol
  - Damage-link
  - Trap link
  - Energy link?
  - Gifting?
  - Filler link
    - Have a feature that on completion sends out filler/trap items to the MW when complete repeatable checks
- Improve level handling by actually changing the proper addresses
  - Figure out how levels are stored in memory/ how its decided which level to load
  - look into how level editors work : should play around with them
  - and search for info in dc
  - How/where is the games level / enemy info loaded : look at mod tools, figure out if can replace
  - decompile some level files, look at their structure, same with world map
- Improve JIT cache situation
  - Keyboard program causes issues with linux requiring root
  - https://github.com/randovania/py-dolphin-memory-engine/issues/10
  - create a gecko code that loads the instruction for me??
  - or just really on people turning off keybinds require focus
  - In theory I could write some PowerPC assembly that invalidates the cache internally but then I'd have to somehow make it detect external memory modifications and adapt to it. My problem with this method is to find a function to hook onto safely.
- Reenable part of climb that dissabled due to freezes
- Design icon for client : apstyle or mario head
- Fix a better way of doing hint movie logic
- Red coin sanity


## Difficult small bugs to fix
- Sometimes invisible on worldmap
  - Marios animation start from back of world
- Sneak freezes game
- Hint movies that requires all level completion don't work in game : vertify still problem
- DOLPHIN CONNECTION ISSUE
- game randomly freezes : inconsistent experience
- !switch doesnt block levels like 8-5 which are instant
- goomba patch errors when level doesn't goomba: rough write
- sometimes loading world crashes game
  - yea so loading my state from world 4-C and then trying to switch worlds just crashes : invalid read
  - ask for sead

## Game patches

## Long term
- Non ap rando (enemy, level, entrance)
  - One of set world level / level world changes ingame level: can be used for level rando
- Do something with coin battles?
  - Maybe have location for collecting at least % in levels, each level is an item
- Get rid of keyboard
  - Can do this by creating a instruction write wrapper that writes instruction to data and then have function in game load it instead: icbi followed by isync
- Fix so work with multiple dolphin instances
- Add support for other mods: pipe rando, mkwcat 8player, newer (needs logic), etc
  - Needs to create new memory map (on the fly? or need to create it for all editions), would be helpful for using the memory patch with the randomizer


## Features I (Miiroun) will not implement
- Native wii support
- Randomized ?-blocks
- Coin sanity
